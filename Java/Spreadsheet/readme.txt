This program simulates a collaborative real-time spreadsheet editor similar to Google Spreadsheet. The program operates on an input and output text file. The input file contains a formatted list of the current documents, corresponding users and also operations to perform on the database. The server than writes the resulting to an output.txt file after every operation is applied to the database. The allowed operations include set, clear, add, subtract, multiply, divide, undo and redo.
